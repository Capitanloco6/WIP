EVTDESC9900;The tribes living in Hindukush Mountains were always plagued by unrest. But due to rash innovations made in the Empire and the recent uprisings in both the Punjab and the semi-nomadic turkish tribes in Anatolia, the Eastern Tribes seek more and more independence from Herat. It seems that the tribes are gathering owns again, even gaining support from both Baluchis and Hazara communities. Our rule is challenge, this situation could easily escalate if we dont act quick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT9900OPTA;They will bow to my will! Treat them like Timur did!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT9900OPTB;They aren't a threat for our Empire, we'll just wait this situation out. No autonomy will be given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT9900OPTC;The Empire cant handle such a rebellion right now, we need to prevent further unrest. Give them more autonomy! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
